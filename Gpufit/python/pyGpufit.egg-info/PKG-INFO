Description: Python binding for the [Gpufit library](https://github.com/gpufit/Gpufit) which implements Levenberg Marquardt curve fitting in CUDA
        
        Requirements
        
        - A CUDA capable graphics card with a recent Nvidia graphics driver (at least 367.48 / July 2016)
        - Windows
        - Python 2 or 3 with NumPy
        
        Installation
        
        Currently the wheel file has to be installed locally.
        
        If NumPy is not yet installed, install it using pip from the command line
        
        pip install numpy
        
        Then install pyGpufit from the local folder via:
        
        pip install --no-index --find-links=LocalPathToWheelFile pyGpufit
        
        Examples
        
        See examples folder.
        
        Troubleshooting
        
        A common reason for the error message 'CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version' is an outdated Nvidia graphics driver.
